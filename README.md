SwatTAB
=======

A Debate Tournament Tabbing Program, developed for use by the American Parliamentary Debate Association.

This program is designed to fully tab a standard APDA tournament. Teams are seeded in an adjustable order using any of the following criteria:

Record, Speaks, Ranks, Adjusted Speaks, Adjusted Ranks, Double Adjusted Speaks, Double Adjusted Ranks, Strength of 
Competition (wins), Std Dev of Speaks, Std Dev of Ranks, Coin Flip

No team will be pulled up more than once, and no team will hit the pull-up more than once. No team will get the bye more than once. 

Team protection will be respected, no two teams will hit each other more than once. 
No team will be judged by their own school. No team will see the same judge twice.

Pairing will ALWAYS maintain the bracket and only pull-up ONE team (that has not already been the pull up). Within the bracket, we will attempt to avoid (in the following order):
1) Re-hitting the Pull-Up
2) School Affiliation Conflict
3) Rehitting a team Conflict
4) Gov/Opp Conflicts
